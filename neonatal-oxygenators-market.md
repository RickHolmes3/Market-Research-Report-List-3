<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neonatal Oxygenators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hollow Fiber Oxygenators</li><li>Membrane Oxygenators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Neonatal oxygenators are used for providing oxygen during surgeries or respiratory support for newborn babies. Hollow fiber oxygenators are a type of neonatal oxygenator that use hollow fibers to transfer oxygen into the baby's blood. They are efficient and offer a large surface area for gas exchange. On the other hand, membrane oxygenators use a thin membrane to transfer oxygen, making them more compact and easy to use. Both types play a crucial role in ensuring adequate oxygenation for neonates, but differ in their design and functionality.</p></p>
