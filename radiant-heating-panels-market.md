<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radiant Heating Panels Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electric Radiation</li><li>Infrared Radiation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radiant heating panels come in two main types - electric radiation and infrared radiation. Electric radiation panels work by using electricity to heat up a series of coils or elements that then radiate heat into the room. Infrared radiation panels, on the other hand, emit infrared radiation that heats up objects and people in the room directly, similar to the warmth of the sun. Both types of panels are popular choices for heating homes and commercial spaces efficiently and effectively.</p></p>
