<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The ADHD Medications Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stimulant</li><li>Non-stimulant</li></ul></p>
<p><p>ADHD medications are divided into two main types: stimulant and non-stimulant medications. Stimulant medications, such as methylphenidate and amphetamines, work by increasing the levels of certain neurotransmitters in the brain, which helps improve attention and reduce hyperactivity and impulsivity. They are considered the first-line treatment for ADHD due to their effectiveness. Non-stimulant medications, such as atomoxetine and guanfacine, work by targeting different neurotransmitters and have a longer duration of action. They are typically prescribed when stimulant medications are not well-tolerated or are ineffective. Both types of medications aim to help individuals with ADHD manage their symptoms and improve their daily functioning.</p></p>
