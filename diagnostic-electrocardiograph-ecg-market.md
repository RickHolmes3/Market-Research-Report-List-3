<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diagnostic Electrocardiograph (ECG) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Resting ECG</li><li>Stress ECG</li><li>Holter ECG</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Diagnostic Electrocardiograph (ECG) market includes three main types - Resting ECG, Stress ECG, and Holter ECG. Resting ECG is done while the patient is at rest, providing a baseline reading of the heart's electrical activity. Stress ECG involves monitoring the heart's activity during physical exertion to detect any abnormalities that may not be present at rest. Holter ECG involves wearing a portable monitor for 24-48 hours to continuously record the heart's activity, providing a more comprehensive picture of the heart's function.</p></p>
