<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Feed Mycotoxin Binders and Modifiers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Binders</li><li>Modifiers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Feed mycotoxin binders and modifiers are additives used in animal feed to counteract the harmful effects of mycotoxins, which are toxic substances produced by fungi. Binders work by binding to mycotoxins and preventing them from being absorbed in the animal's digestive system, while modifiers work by altering the structure of mycotoxins to make them less toxic. The binders and modifiers market is divided into two main categories, with binders being more commonly used due to their ability to physically adsorb mycotoxins.</p></p>
