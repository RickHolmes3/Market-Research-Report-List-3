<p><strong>RAF Proto Oncogene Serine/Threonine Protein Kinase Major Market Players</strong></p>
<p><p>RAF Proto Oncogene Serine/Threonine Protein Kinase, commonly known as RAF kinase, is a protein kinase involved in the regulation of cell growth and division. It plays a crucial role in the MAP kinase/ERK signaling pathway and is therefore a potential target for cancer therapy. The market for RAF protein kinase inhibitors is highly competitive, with several major pharmaceutical companies involved in the development and commercialization of drugs targeting this pathway.</p><p>One of the key players in the RAF kinase market is F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., a Swiss multinational healthcare company. Roche has developed a RAF inhibitor called vemurafenib (trade name Zelboraf), which has been approved for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. Vemurafenib has shown significant market growth since its approval in 2011 and has become a standard of care for patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma. Roche has reported sales revenue of approximately $1.4 billion for its RAF kinase inhibitor portfolio in 2020.</p><p>Novartis AG, a Swiss multinational pharmaceutical company, is another prominent player in the RAF kinase market. Novartis has developed two RAF inhibitors, dabrafenib (trade name Tafinlar) and trametinib (trade name Mekinist). These drugs have been approved for the treatment of BRAF-mutant melanoma and have also shown promising results in other cancer types. The sales revenue for Novartis' RAF kinase inhibitors in 2020 was approximately $1.18 billion.</p><p>Eli Lilly and Company, an American pharmaceutical company, is also actively involved in the development of RAF kinase inhibitors. Lilly's RAF inhibitor, ulixertinib, is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of various solid tumors. The market growth for ulixertinib will depend on the success of ongoing clinical trials and regulatory approvals. However, sales revenue data for Lilly's RAF kinase inhibitors is not available as these drugs are still in the development stage.</p><p>Other notable players in the RAF kinase market include Basilea Pharmaceutica AG, Hanmi Pharmaceuticals, Co. Ltd., Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Redx Pharma Plc, Sirnaomics, Inc., and VG Life Sciences, Inc. These companies are involved in various stages of drug development for RAF protein kinase inhibitors and their market growth and revenue are expected to be determined by the success of their clinical trials and regulatory approvals.</p><p>In summary, the RAF proto oncogene serine/threonine protein kinase market is highly competitive, with major players such as Roche and Novartis leading the market with approved drugs. Other companies like Eli Lilly and Basilea Pharmaceutica are also actively engaged in drug development and their market growth will depend on the success of their ongoing clinical trials. The market size for RAF kinase inhibitors is expected to expand with the increasing prevalence of cancers driven by RAF mutations and the potential for combination therapies targeting the MAP kinase/ERK pathway.</p></p>
