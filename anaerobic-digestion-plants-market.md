<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anaerobic Digestion Plants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mesophilic Digestion</li><li>Thermophilic Digestion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Anaerobic digestion plants are facilities that use anaerobic bacteria to break down organic waste and produce biogas. The market can be categorized into two types: mesophilic digestion and thermophilic digestion. Mesophilic digestion takes place at moderate temperatures (around 25-40°C), while thermophilic digestion occurs at higher temperatures (around 50-60°C). Both types have their advantages and disadvantages. Mesophilic digestion is less energy demanding and has a higher tolerance to changes in organic load, while thermophilic digestion offers faster reaction rates and better pathogen removal. The choice depends on the specific needs and conditions of the plant.</p></p>
