<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rapid Diagnostic Test Kits Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Lateral Flow Test</li><li>Agglutination Assay</li><li>Immunochromatographic Assay</li><li>Immunospot Assay</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rapid diagnostic test kits are used to quickly and efficiently diagnose diseases or infections. There are four main types of rapid diagnostic test kits: lateral flow tests, agglutination assays, immunochromatographic assays, and immunospot assays. Lateral flow tests use capillary action to detect specific analytes, agglutination assays rely on the clumping of particles to identify the presence of a particular antigen, immunochromatographic assays use antibodies to produce a visible reaction, and immunospot assays measure the number of cells producing a specific antigen. These different types play a crucial role in diagnosing various diseases and infections rapidly.</p></p>
