<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Micromotor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Brushed DC Motor</li><li>Brushless DC Motor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive micromotor market consists of two main types: Brushed DC Motor and Brushless DC Motor. Brushed DC motors use brushes to transfer electrical current to the rotor, creating movement. They are simpler in design and less expensive than brushless DC motors, but are less efficient and require more maintenance. Brushless DC motors, on the other hand, do not use brushes and instead rely on electronic commutation to control the motor's speed and direction. They are more efficient, reliable, and have a longer lifespan compared to brushed DC motors.</p></p>
