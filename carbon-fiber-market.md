<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carbon Fiber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Regular-Tow Carbon Fiber</li><li>Large-Tow Carbon Fiber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The carbon fiber market is divided into two main types, namely regular-tow carbon fiber and large-tow carbon fiber. Regular-tow carbon fiber refers to fibers with a lower number of filaments, typically ranging from 1,000 to 12,000 filaments. It is commonly used in applications where a high strength-to-weight ratio is required, such as aerospace and automotive industries. On the other hand, large-tow carbon fiber, as the name suggests, consists of a higher number of filaments, usually over 24,000. This type of carbon fiber is often employed in less weight-sensitive applications like wind energy, sports equipment, and pressure vessels.</p></p>
