<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surgical Drainage Tube Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Drains</li><li>Active Drains</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Surgical drainage tubes are essential instruments used to remove excess fluids or air from surgical sites. Passive drains function through gravity, using a collection vessel to drain fluids naturally. Active drains, on the other hand, involve external suction to accelerate fluid removal, regulating pressure with a vacuum. While passive drains are simpler and less expensive, active drains offer more control and potential for faster healing. Both types serve to prevent complications and aid in postoperative recovery.</p></p>
