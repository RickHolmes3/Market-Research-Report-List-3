<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hospital Delivery Robot Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Magnet Navigation</li><li>Laser Navigation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hospital delivery robot market includes two types of navigation systems: Magnet Navigation and Laser Navigation. Magnet Navigation utilizes magnetic strips, which are embedded in the floor of the hospital, to guide the robot along specific routes. This system is cost-effective and reliable but lacks flexibility. On the other hand, Laser Navigation uses lasers to create a 2D map of the environment, allowing the robot to navigate more freely and avoid obstacles. This system is more advanced and offers greater flexibility, but it is also more expensive.</p></p>
