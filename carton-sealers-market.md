<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carton Sealers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fully Automatic Carton Sealer</li><li>Semi-Automatic Carton Sealer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fully automatic carton sealers are machines that can automatically flap, fold, and seal boxes without any human intervention. They are ideal for high-volume packaging lines due to their efficiency and speed. On the other hand, semi-automatic carton sealers require some manual effort, such as feeding the box into the machine and manually folding the flaps before sealing. While semi-automatic sealers are less efficient than fully automatic ones, they are more cost-effective for smaller production volumes.</p></p>
