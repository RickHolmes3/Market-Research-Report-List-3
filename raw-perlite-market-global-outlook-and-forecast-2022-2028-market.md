<p><p>The raw perlite market refers to the global market for the mineral perlite in its raw form. Perlite is an amorphous volcanic glass that is largely composed of silica. It is formed when obsidian, a volcanic rock, is heated rapidly, causing the water trapped within it to expand and create a foam-like structure. Perlite has low density, excellent heat resistance, and good insulation properties, making it a versatile material in various industries.</p><p>The global raw perlite market is expected to witness significant growth during the forecast period of 2022-2028. The market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 8.6% during this period. This growth can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the expanding construction industry, especially in developing countries, is driving the demand for perlite as it is used in lightweight concrete and plaster mixes. Additionally, the growing popularity of hydroponics, a soilless gardening method, is also boosting the demand for perlite as it is an essential component in hydroponic systems.</p><p>Moreover, the increasing use of perlite in horticulture, insulation, filtration, agriculture, and foundry applications is further propelling the market growth. Perlite is used as a soil additive in horticulture to improve drainage and aeration of the soil, as well as for seed starting and propagation. In the construction industry, it is used as an insulating material, while in the filtration industry, it is utilized for water and air filtration. In the agriculture sector, perlite is used as a soil amendment and in animal feed.</p><p>The market is witnessing various trends, such as the development of perlite-based sustainable construction materials, advancements in perlite production techniques, and the increasing adoption of perlite in the aerospace industry for lightweight insulation. These trends are likely to contribute to the growth of the raw perlite market during the forecast period.</p></p>
