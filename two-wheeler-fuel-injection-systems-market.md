<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Two Wheeler Fuel Injection Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Fuel Injection System</li><li>Port Fuel Injection System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Direct Fuel Injection System is a more advanced type of fuel injection system where fuel is directly injected into the combustion chamber of each cylinder. This system is known for providing better fuel efficiency, increased power and reduced emissions compared to Port Fuel Injection System. On the other hand, Port Fuel Injection System injects fuel into the intake port just before the intake valve, allowing for a more even distribution of fuel to each cylinder. Both systems play a crucial role in optimizing engine performance in Two Wheeler vehicles.</p></p>
