<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Steel Refining Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hybrid</li><li>Premelted</li><li>Sintered</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Steel refining agents are used in the steel-making process to remove impurities and improve the quality of the final product. There are three main types of steel refining agents: hybrid, premelted, and sintered. Hybrid agents combine the benefits of both premelted and sintered agents, providing an efficient and cost-effective solution. Premelted agents are typically in liquid form and are added directly to the molten metal. Sintered agents, on the other hand, are solid materials that are added to the steel bath and react with the impurities to improve the steel quality.</p></p>
