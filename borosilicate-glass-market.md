<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Borosilicate Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High Borosilicate Glass</li><li>Medium Borosilicate Glass</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Borosilicate glass is categorized into two main types based on the boron content: high borosilicate glass and medium borosilicate glass. High borosilicate glass contains a higher percentage of boron oxide, making it more resistant to thermal shock and chemical corrosion. It is commonly used in laboratory glassware, pharmaceutical packaging, and high-end kitchenware. On the other hand, medium borosilicate glass has a lower boron content and is often utilized in lighting fixtures, decorative glassware, and industrial applications where high chemical resistance is not required.</p></p>
