<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydrophobic Silica Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fumed</li><li>Precipitated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hydrophobic silica is a type of silica that repels water. It is commonly used in various industries such as pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and coatings. There are two main types of hydrophobic silica on the market: fumed silica and precipitated silica. Fumed silica is produced through a high-temperature flame hydrolysis process, resulting in fine particles with a large surface area. Precipitated silica, on the other hand, is manufactured through a chemical reaction between sodium silicate and a mineral acid, producing particles with a more porous and irregular structure.</p></p>
