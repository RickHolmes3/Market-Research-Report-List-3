<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Proteasome Inhibitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bortezomib</li><li>Carfilzomib</li><li>Ixazomib</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Proteasome inhibitors are a class of drugs used in the treatment of cancer. Bortezomib, carfilzomib, and ixazomib are the three main types of proteasome inhibitors available in the market. Bortezomib was the first proteasome inhibitor approved for clinical use and is used primarily in the treatment of multiple myeloma. Carfilzomib is another proteasome inhibitor approved for the treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Lastly, ixazomib is an oral proteasome inhibitor used in combination with other drugs for the treatment of multiple myeloma. These inhibitors work by targeting and blocking the activity of proteasomes, which are responsible for breaking down proteins within cells. By inhibiting proteasome function, these drugs can disrupt cancer cell growth and promote cell death.</p></p>
